## Overview of the project<br />
  This is the research project journal of Group 6 for SPl MDs606 Data Science Research and Ethics.<br />
  Research topic:<br />
  
## Project Description Topic 8: AI in Healthcare System: The use of AI in analyzing patient data and recommending personalized treatment plans based on historical outcomes.<br />
  Research question:Q#1: As most AI recommendations are without any specific reason, their recommendation is based on the Black-box technique, Doctors don't know the reason behind that recommendation, which is why doctors hesitate to rely on AI recommendations. We need to develop an AI recommendation for our healthcare that provides the reason behind their recommendation.
<br />
  Hypothesis:1-  When someone gets their personalized recommendation treatment from an AI system there should be a higher similarity between AI-recommended decisions and doctor-suggested treatment for a patient. So, in this way, we donâ€™t need to get an explanation in all cases.  These similarities can be accessed through the concordance rate, if the concordance rate is high then both the AI system and Doctors agree with each other and vice versa.
