### Introduction:
When discussing AI-generated personalized treatment plans for a patient, it’s important to understand how it works. AI systems collect data on past patients and their diseases to suggest cures. In the collection of data, a lot of factors including lifestyle, blood Group, and Medical History of a patient are being considered. For example, if a person smokes, then the probability of developing Lung cancer is higher, so AI suggests a treatment based on people‘s current lifestyle. This type of system provides an increasingly accurate possible outcome, as the system gets more data from the patients the AI system performs better. 

### Why am I interested in this topic?
Nowadays, personalized treatment is a trending topic in the healthcare system,  as people receive personalized treatments, the side effects of the cure will be fewer and recovery will be faster. Due to this treatment plan, doctors will use this information from AI and suggest a better treatment for that person. AI recommends a personal treatment plan for every patient, allowing doctors to spend more time with the patient, which increases efficiency and improves the patient’s experience. The traditional healthcare system is expensive in most countries and it often provides some unnecessary tests for the patients due to its inflexibility. Another interesting reason to choose this topic is to reduce the cost of treatment for well-being and avoid unnecessary test checkups.

### Research Question:

How effective is AI in recommending personalized treatment plans compared to the traditional doctor-recommended treatments？

### Hypotheses:
When someone gets their personalized recommendation treatment from an AI system there should be a higher similarity between AI-recommended decisions and doctor-suggested treatment for a patient. So, in this way, we don’t need to get an explanation in all cases.  These similarities can be accessed through the concordance rate, if the concordance rate is high then both the AI system and Doctors agree with each other and vice versa. If the concordance rate still remains higher in most cases then doctors will leave most of the treatment to an AI system.


### Data Sources and Collection Methods:
The secondary data collection method is going to be used for analysis from the Kaggle website. First, we need to search for specific data only related to our research topic after confirmation we need to download that CSV file, organize that into our system through the import command, and then perform preprocessing on that dataset to get an internal insight into our dataset we have to perform Exploratory Data Analysis, and after this need to visualize that dataset to get more idea about the dataset.
### Data Analysis Approach:
We will use these approaches for data analysis
-	**Data Preprocessing and cleaning empty or null values**
-	**Statistical Analysis: We will perform descriptive analysis to get the main summary of our dataset (standard deviations, frequencies, means).**
-	**In Inferential statistical analysis, we will use our hypothesis to get the performance comparison between the black-box model and our explainable AI model. At this time we will get results like a concordance rate between the AI system and the Doctor's decision.**
-	**Data Visualization: We will get insight through histogram line chart box-plot our data to see if there pattern exists.**
-	**Machine Learning model:  We will use machine learning algorithm classification to make a classifier model and then predict the outcome through that fit model.**
-	**Model Evaluation: We will use accuracy, precision and F1-score  matrics to get performance of our model. We have to also conduct interviews with the doctor to get information about the results and compare it with the AI  system.**
-	**Interpretation and final report: I need to interpret my findings according to my research question and hypothesis. After I prepare the final report and mention the limitation of data analysis approach.**
-	**Programming Language: We will use Python language for code and visualization and use some libraries like Seaborn, matplotlib, pandas and as well as model import libraries like sklearn.**

### Expected Outcome:
We analyze patient data through an AI System and align that decision with an Expert Doctor. We make decisions on the based of Concordance rate, initially be concordance rate will be lower, but with the passage of time efficiently train data to get an accurate AI system. Expectedly, We can also discover new personal treatments for patients that have not yet been discovered. The major contribution to the field is that find area where AI perform better and point out the area where AI performance is low. So, in this way, we can develop a better AI system in the Healthcare field.
